# Getting started.

## Online editor

The quickest way to get started on the compiler is with the
[web editor](/editor). There you can write javascript/typescript code and benefit from the built-in autocompletion and live compilation features.

## Local setup

This section assumes that you are familiar with the following concepts:

- The command line terminal
- Using javascript package managers

If you want to edit your scripts in your preferred editor you can install
the compiler locally by running the command bellow.

```
npm i -g mlogjs
```

Then you will be able to compile your scripts with the `mlogjs` command:

```
mlogjs my_script.js
```
